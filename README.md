### Bio

I believe data has the power to transform businesses—when it’s accessible, insightful, and actionable. My mission is to bridge the gap between raw numbers and meaningful decisions by crafting data-driven solutions that empower organizations to grow smarter and faster. 

With over 15 years of experience in tax consulting, compliance, and analytics, I’ve honed my ability to simplify complexity and deliver results. At PwC, I led a nationwide tax reporting module, improving data accessibility for thousands of clients and saving significant time across teams. I’ve also developed dashboards that secured multi-million-dollar proposals and implemented automation strategies that saved thousands of work hours—proving that efficiency and innovation go hand in hand. 

I specialize in data storytelling, process optimization, and cross-functional collaboration. Whether building strategic dashboards, streamlining workflows, or solving complex business challenges, I thrive on turning data into actionable insights that drive impact. My technical skills include expertise in Power BI, Tableau, SQL and advanced data visualization tools, paired with a passion for fostering a data-driven culture. 

Outside of work, I find inspiration in travel, puzzles, and culinary adventures—creativity that fuels my problem-solving mindset. I’m always eager to connect with like-minded professionals who share my passion for leveraging data to make a difference. 

Let’s connect—I’d love to explore how we can turn your data into your greatest asset.
