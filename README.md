### Bio

I believe data has the power to transform businessesâ€”when itâ€™s accessible, insightful, and actionable. My mission is to bridge the gap between raw numbers and meaningful decisions by crafting data-driven solutions that empower organizations to grow smarter and faster. 

With over 15 years of experience in tax consulting, compliance, analytics and product management, Iâ€™ve honed my ability to simplify complexity and deliver results. At PwC, I led a nationwide tax reporting module, improving data accessibility for thousands of clients and saving time across teams. Dashboards that I developed have secured multi-million dollar proposals while my automation strategies have saved thousands of work hours â€” proving that efficiency and innovation go hand in hand. 

I specialize in strategizing how to improve data products, opimitizing processes and collaborating cross-functionally (e.g., with engineering, sales, support teams, customer success, go-to-market teams). Whether building strategic dashboards, streamlining workflows, or solving complex business challenges, I thrive on turning data into actionable insights that drive impact. My technical skills include expertise in advanced data visualization tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) and data analytics tools (e.g., Python, SQL), as well as core product management skills like serving as scrum master in agile development.

Outside of work, I find inspiration in travel, puzzles, and culinary adventures. Iâ€™m always eager to connect with like-minded professionals who share my passion for leveraging data to make a difference.
