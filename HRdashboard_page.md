## HR Employee Dashboard

**Project description:**  Using Power Query and Power BI, I combined performance assessment results and employee survey results with basic employee data for AquaSync, a fictional company, to uncover how the company may increase employee retention.

### 1. Understand the problem

**Problem statement:** AquaSync is a fictional software-as-a-service (SaaS) business designed to streamline water management for municipalities, agricultural sectors, and industrial users. The company's Human Resources (HR) has noticed more employees leaving the company and would like to know how they could address this.

### 2. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of problem

AquaSync has formed the following hypotheses: 

- Employees may not be satisfied with their salaries.
- Employees are not receiving enough training.
- Employees are travelling too much.

### 3. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 4. Analyze the dataset to validate hypotheses and form solution strategy

For more details, see the [dashboard](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) on Power BI.

### 5. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments

- Why does AquaSync have so many more Sales Executives than Sales Representatives?
- To gain more insights into the performance reviews, add components for managers to assess employees on company values such as innovation, teamwork, etc.
- Also add components to employee surveys.
- Conduct a competitive analysis.
