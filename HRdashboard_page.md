## HR Employee Dashboard

**Project description:** AquaSync is a software as a service company that regularly assesses the performance and outlook of its employees. The goal of this project is to increase employee retention by combining performance assessment results with basic employee data to reveal actionable insights.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments

- Why does AquaSync have so many more Sales Executives than Sales Representatives?
- Add components to employee surveys that correspond to company values.
