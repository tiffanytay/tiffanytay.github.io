## HR Employee Dashboard

**Project description:** AquaSync is a fictional software-as-a-service (SaaS) business designed to streamline water management for municipalities, agricultural sectors, and industrial users. The company wishes to increase employee job satisfaction and employee retention. This project reveals actionable insights through data manipulation and data visualization - using Power Query and Power BI to combine performance assessment results with basic employee data.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

AquaSync has formed the following hypotheses: 

```javascript
Employees may not be satisfied with their salaries.
```
```javascript
Employees are not receiving enough training.
```
```javascript
Employees are travelling too much.
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments

- Why does AquaSync have so many more Sales Executives than Sales Representatives?
- To gain more insights into the performance reviews, add components for managers to assess employees on company values such as innovation, teamwork, etc.

For more details, see the [dashboard](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) on Power BI.
