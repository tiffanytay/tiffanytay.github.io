## A Snapshot of NYC Dogs

**Project Overview:** Analyzed multiple datasets to create a comprehensive visualization of dog ownership and infrastructure in New York City using Power Query and Power BI.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Integrated and cleaned 5 diverse datasets from NYC Open Data and other sources, including dog licenses, parks, waste receptacles, and zip code mappings.
- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing dog demographics, infrastructure distribution, and geographical insights across NYC boroughs.
- Uncovered surprising trends, such as the popularity of medium-large breeds in Manhattan and the concentration of dogs in Northwest Brooklyn.
- Utilized GenAI (Perplexity AI) to draft the initial Power BI theme file, demonstrating proficiency in leveraging AI tools for data visualization.

**Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
- Data Cleaning and Transformation: Power Query
- Data Visualization: Power BI, custom theme creation
- Data Analysis: Demographic and geographic trend identification
- AI Integration: Used GenAI for design assistance

**Key Insights:**
- Labs and Goldendoodles are the most popular licensed breeds in Manhattan, despite space constraints.
- Manhattan has the most dog runs but the least waste bag dispensers.
- Northwest Brooklyn has the highest concentration of dogs.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Update datasets to 2024 data
- Address squirrel data gaps
- Create drill-through pages by borough/neighborhood
- Integrate additional relevant datasets (e.g., pet store data, animal rescue data, animal bites)
- Implement map visualizations for geographic insights

**Impact:** This project showcases the ability to synthesize multiple data sources into a cohesive, interactive dashboard, providing valuable insights for urban planning, pet-related businesses, and community services in NYC.
