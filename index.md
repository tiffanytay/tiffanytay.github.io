## About Me

With over 15 years of experience spanning international tax consulting, compliance and data analytics, I've evolved into a resourceful data storyteller who bridges the gap between complex financial information and actionable business insights. 

I am currently a Tax Technology Manager at PwC, where I lead a tax reporting module launched nationwide, resulting in enhanced data accessibility for thousands of clients and significant time savings. My expertise lies in transforming raw data into strategic assets, whether it's through developing comprehensive dashboards that secure multi-million dollar proposals or implementing automation strategies that save thousands of work hours. I thrive on using data to solve complex business problems and am passionate about fostering a data-driven culture that empowers organizations to make informed decisions.

Before PwC, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with both a bachelors and masters degree in accounting. My credentials include a CPA license in NY and TX, as well as a culinary certification from the Natural Gourmet Institute in NYC.

I value beautiful design and efficiency. When not working, I love to draw inspiration from travel, hang out with dogs, try new foods and take on challenging puzzles.
