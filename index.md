## About Me

With over a decade of experience spanning international tax consulting and data analytics, I've evolved into a versatile data storyteller who bridges the gap between complex financial information and actionable business insights. My journey from a CPA to a Tax Technology Manager at PwC has honed my ability to leverage cutting-edge tools like Alteryx, Power BI, and Python to revolutionize tax reporting and drive efficiency. I've led cross-functional teams to develop scalable reporting solutions, resulting in enhanced data accessibility for thousands of clients and significant time savings. My expertise lies in transforming raw data into strategic assets, whether it's through developing comprehensive dashboards that secure multi-million dollar proposals or implementing automation strategies that save thousands of work hours. I thrive on using data to solve complex business problems and am passionate about fostering a data-driven culture that empowers organizations to make informed decisions.
