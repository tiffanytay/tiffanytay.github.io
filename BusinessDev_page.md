## Financial Planning

**Project description:** [ ]

### 1. Understand the problem

**Problem statement:** TechnoServe, a fictional tech SaaS (Software as a service) startup that specialises in different types of cloud-based software services that increase productivity for their small and medium enterprise customers.

The revenue that the company generates is highly dependent on the consumption of the cloud services that they provide and thus, is highly dependent on the number of clients that the company has. 

The problem that the company is facing is that its pipeline conversion percentage has dropped from 35% at the end of the last fiscal (FY 2019-20) to 25% at present.

**Additional background:** The company is based out of Delaware and started its operations in 2010. Clients are spread throughout the US. There are more than 600 employees, distributed over multiple teams. It has a wide variety of IT solutions spread across different industries.

### 2. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of problem

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 4. Analyze the dataset to validate hypotheses and form solution strategy
